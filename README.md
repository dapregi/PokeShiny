This is the source code for a pokemon explorer app which runs on R and Shiny. 

This app allows you to filter and plot pokemon data depending on different variables. 
In addition, you can export your filtered data.

All the pokemon data was retrieved through [PokeAPI](http://pokeapi.co/), a RESTful API for [Pokemon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon). This data show some basic stats for each of the first 151 pokemon.

To run it locally you'll need to install the latest versions of [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/).

The applet was made as a project for Coursera's class on Developing Data Products, and it is published in https://dapregi.shinyapps.io/pkmn/ and http://rpubs.com/... .
